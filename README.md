# DAA-Assignment2

Graph coloring is the procedure of assignment of colors to each vertex of a graph G such that no adjacent vertices get same color.
The objective is to minimize the number of colors while coloring a graph. The smallest number of colors required to color a graph G is called its chromatic number of that graph.

Test Case 1 -- > Here for Graph1  when M = 3 colors are allocated to the vertices as per the graph coloring Rules ,
Test Case 2 -- >
But for similar graph when M = 2 , 2 colors were insufficient to be assigned to the vertices keeping adjacent colors different.
Test Case 3 --> 
Here with M = 2 also we are able to do the graph coloring , Since the vertices are connected in different manner .
